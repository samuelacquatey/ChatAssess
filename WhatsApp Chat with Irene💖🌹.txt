13/09/2024, 21:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: as a nurse
13/09/2024, 21:10 - Irene💖🌹: i’ll probably ask if you’re stressed out or something…headaches don’t just start. Then i’d advice you to drink some water and get some sleep 
Most headaches start because of hunger too so i’d advice you to eat some good food too
13/09/2024, 21:12 - Irene💖🌹: but i don’t think people know that not every pain in the head is normal headache
13/09/2024, 21:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah very true
13/09/2024, 21:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: sometimes people just don't want to be nosy
13/09/2024, 21:15 - Irene💖🌹: i wouldn’t tell you i was having a headache if i didn’t want you to know . I’ll not just go round telling anyone 
i told you because i wanted you to know. I wanted you to be worried about me . maybe i also wanted you to comfort me
13/09/2024, 21:15 - Irene💖🌹: do you get??
13/09/2024, 21:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: Well now i know
13/09/2024, 21:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's worth saying you're not like everyone else so it still stands
13/09/2024, 21:19 - Irene💖🌹: what does that mean??
13/09/2024, 21:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: some people say it to getyou off their backs 🤷🏽‍♂️
13/09/2024, 21:22 - Irene💖🌹: well let’s not leave that part out 
sometimes you might be genuinely tired or something because you had a hectic day . I could tell you that too but then not make it look like i’m trying to get rid of you

13/09/2024, 21:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: 😂
13/09/2024, 21:49 - Irene💖🌹: we’re all sinful….what matters is that you know your way to him . He’s always ready to accept us despite . I feel like God himself understands
13/09/2024, 21:49 - Irene💖🌹: It’s slow but definitely and surely he knows we’re His so He’s patient enough

18/09/2024, 22:40 - Irene💖🌹: yes…boys areee scaaarrryyyy 
i’ve had my own share 
i’ve been through things that shouldn’t have happened to an 8 year old
18/09/2024, 22:40 - Irene💖🌹: why don’t boys just go ahead and say it when they like someone??
18/09/2024, 22:41 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: woah 8?
18/09/2024, 22:42 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: fear of rejection mostly. why what's your experience
18/09/2024, 22:42 - Irene💖🌹: yep ….i don’t like to talk about it 
maybe i’ll tell you about it some other time
18/09/2024, 22:43 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so that's the second thing you've promised to tell me some other time
18/09/2024, 22:44 - Irene💖🌹: not really mine 
but a friend’s 
it happened in high school tho 
this boy showed signs clearly that he wanted her but he never really said it
18/09/2024, 22:44 - Irene💖🌹: what’s the first?
18/09/2024, 22:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but honestly that's just nasty. at 8? I'm really sorry about that. I also had an experience like that so I can understand quite well
18/09/2024, 22:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: something nobody knows about you
18/09/2024, 22:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah that's it. he didn't want to get rejected
18/09/2024, 22:46 - Irene💖🌹: well sorry about yours too 
i’ve not really gotten over mine 
sometimes i just sit and have flashbacks. But it’s all good 
i just know it’s never going to happen again
18/09/2024, 22:47 - Irene💖🌹: i think this was it 
but i’ll really tell you when i’m comfortable with talking about it
18/09/2024, 22:47 - Irene💖🌹: oh okay

18/09/2024, 22:50 - Irene💖🌹: for now i’ve gotten to understand not all of them are the same i’ve met some good ones (like my brother) and the bad ones are there too
18/09/2024, 22:51 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: that's good to hear
18/09/2024, 22:51 - Irene💖🌹: mm yh
18/09/2024, 22:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what makes this a dark place to be is the guilt that you feel which makes you unable to share with anyone
18/09/2024, 22:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm no therapist but if you ever want to talk about it you have me
18/09/2024, 22:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: we could do it over a bowl of fufu or something 🙃

28/09/2024, 19:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I find fulfilment in connecting with people, understanding the parts to their character that no one has been curious enough to learn. it's something I never received and I intend to give it out.

28/09/2024, 20:38 - Irene💖🌹: because i’m trying to play safe

28/09/2024, 20:43 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I said let's be friends because I dont want to rush anything. love should develop naturally without expectations. that's what I'm hoping will happen
28/09/2024, 20:43 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: maybe if you asked I'll tell you🙃
28/09/2024, 20:45 - Irene💖🌹: i wasn’t interested in knowing at first

28/09/2024, 21:05 - Irene💖🌹: ???
28/09/2024, 21:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: no we're going to talk about it
28/09/2024, 21:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you can't keep acting like you don't have a heart to protect the one you have
28/09/2024, 21:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and if I was going to do anything bad to you you would have figured that out by now
28/09/2024, 21:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so you should start considering opening up so we can talk about it
28/09/2024, 21:14 - Irene💖🌹: okaaayyy

28/09/2024, 21:29 - Irene💖🌹: i don’t think i’m prepared for this conversation

29/09/2024, 19:41 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do you mind sharing why it is draining?
29/09/2024, 19:45 - Irene💖🌹: because i don’t like being the way i am 
i try to change and i can’t 
i look at people who are doing great for themselves (people who appreciate who and what they are) and i wonder why i can’t do same for myself
29/09/2024, 19:47 - Irene💖🌹: plus i feel insecure about my voice tooo 
i talk and then everyone is like is that your actual voice (some people think i fake it)
29/09/2024, 19:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah I get it. sometimes it looks like you would never make it there and get to experience what it's like
29/09/2024, 20:06 - Irene💖🌹: ykr

30/09/2024, 21:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I guess I didn't make the point clear enough
30/09/2024, 21:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: when you look at a face long enough,  you'll find all the things that are wrong with it...that's just how it works. and you look at your face everyday so that's what makes you feel that way about yourself

06/10/2024, 11:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: being a church truant
06/10/2024, 11:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: whenever the place doesn't feel good I walk out and go home
06/10/2024, 11:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: just did that
06/10/2024, 11:07 - Irene💖🌹: huh??? when the service isn’t yet over?
06/10/2024, 11:07 - Irene💖🌹: but why
06/10/2024, 11:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
06/10/2024, 11:09 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: don't like the vibe.  they talk more about their pastors than Jesus

06/10/2024, 11:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: ah why are you laughing 😂😂

06/10/2024, 11:14 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I really don't know how😂
06/10/2024, 11:15 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: same for about three of the past 5 times I went to church over the last two years
06/10/2024, 11:19 - Irene💖🌹: but i think you should listen and pick the ones you want and then leave the ones you don’t want
06/10/2024, 11:19 - Irene💖🌹: leaving like that is not really nice 
you can’t do that when you get invited to an event or in class 
will you?
06/10/2024, 11:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: really?
06/10/2024, 11:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: naa that's different
06/10/2024, 11:24 - Irene💖🌹: how?
06/10/2024, 11:24 - Irene💖🌹: yep
06/10/2024, 11:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what's the point if going to church if your time is going to be spent praising human beings and not learning about God
06/10/2024, 11:28 - Irene💖🌹: oh okaaayyy
06/10/2024, 11:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: <Media omitted>

06/10/2024, 11:50 - Irene💖🌹: nah fr 😭
06/10/2024, 11:51 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: don't you have better options though?
06/10/2024, 11:52 - Irene💖🌹: we’re allowed to cook but then you’re not allowed to use an electric cooker or a gas cooker (you can use it illegally tho)
06/10/2024, 11:52 - Irene💖🌹: and i’m not ready to go through that stress so i end up drinking tea,eating cerelac,kivo gari mix and then drinks and biscuits
06/10/2024, 11:53 - Irene💖🌹: i go out to get food when i feel like walking and i go home sometimes to eat
06/10/2024, 11:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: ah then what should you use to cook?
06/10/2024, 11:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: that's not healthy for you
06/10/2024, 11:55 - Irene💖🌹: i really don’t know😂

06/10/2024, 18:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's the body's adapted sleep rhythm or cycle around the day
06/10/2024, 18:31 - Irene💖🌹: oh okay
06/10/2024, 18:32 - Irene💖🌹: nope

06/10/2024, 18:50 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah me too🙃
06/10/2024, 18:51 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: tell me about something that happened recently that gave you a strong change of opinion or mindset
06/10/2024, 18:55 - Irene💖🌹: i can’t really tell you what happened but i realized i can’t really have a friend
06/10/2024, 18:55 - Irene💖🌹: like someone who’d be my person

06/10/2024, 18:56 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: damn you don't trust me like that😅
06/10/2024, 19:00 - Irene💖🌹: not that lol
06/10/2024, 19:00 - Irene💖🌹: idk🤷🏽‍♀️
06/10/2024, 19:01 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: hmm
06/10/2024, 19:07 - Irene💖🌹: <Media omitted>
06/10/2024, 19:09 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what makes it hard to share what happened

06/10/2024, 19:18 - Irene💖🌹: naah it’s fine
06/10/2024, 19:18 - Irene💖🌹: do you think people have misconceptions about you?

06/10/2024, 19:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: both good and bad
06/10/2024, 19:25 - Irene💖🌹: what are some of them?
06/10/2024, 19:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: <Media omitted>
06/10/2024, 19:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: some people think I think I'm better than others because I like to be a line wolf, and people also think I'm very strict (partly true when I'm standing on business)
06/10/2024, 19:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and that I don't like people
06/10/2024, 19:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but I absolutely love people, I enjoy laughing and making fun of my friends and being made fun of. and I'm very loyal
06/10/2024, 19:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the thing I realised is, people don't care to be curious, even in the least, to understand why people are a certain way
06/10/2024, 19:31 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: because people are amazing when you understand who they are on the inside...many people care too much about themselves
06/10/2024, 19:31 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I digressed but it's a topic I think a lot about
06/10/2024, 19:31 - Irene💖🌹: i see
06/10/2024, 19:31 - Irene💖🌹: i don’t like strict people 😭😂
06/10/2024, 19:32 - Irene💖🌹: truth
06/10/2024, 19:32 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm strict when I have to be😂😂 everyone needs tough love sometimes
06/10/2024, 19:33 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
06/10/2024, 19:33 - Irene💖🌹: maybe  lol
06/10/2024, 19:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I know you like a strict man😌
06/10/2024, 19:39 - Irene💖🌹: i don’t 😂

in my defense, being able to do that helps you to be more sympathetic and understand where people are coming from...that way you can treat them to make them feel better or motivate them to work towards your cause

25/10/2024, 22:33 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: did you not find your guardians growing up to be unreliable

25/10/2024, 22:36 - Irene💖🌹: why do you ask tho?
25/10/2024, 22:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okay...
25/10/2024, 22:37 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the affirmative to that question is a reason why most students in the tertiary find it difficult to study

25/10/2024, 22:45 - Irene💖🌹: we literally study different things 
how is that possible???
25/10/2024, 22:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: studying with another person makes reluctant to give in to impulses like watching your phone, stopping and stuff like that
25/10/2024, 22:54 - Irene💖🌹: oh okaaayyy

03/11/2024, 20:12 - Irene💖🌹: yhyh
03/11/2024, 20:12 - Irene💖🌹: what’s that about?
03/11/2024, 20:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what's that
03/11/2024, 20:14 - Irene💖🌹: i’m not so sure but i think it’s about boys who are able to express their emotions properly or better. Boys who accept emotions and what they feel 
there’s this thing about boys being strong and all that….i think the emotional intelligence thingy is saying we should put that “stereotype “ aside so boys can talk about what they feel
03/11/2024, 20:14 - Irene💖🌹: idk if you get
03/11/2024, 20:16 - Irene💖🌹: some girls prefer that their boyfriends cry and tell them what they feel 
it’s like they prefer the boy would tell them whenever they’re going through a hard time or something 
i’m not sure if i’m right tho 
but according to the comments i read this is it
03/11/2024, 20:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: ohh I see
03/11/2024, 20:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I think I get it
03/11/2024, 20:17 - Irene💖🌹: yuh
03/11/2024, 20:17 - Irene💖🌹: why do you ask tho ?
03/11/2024, 20:18 - Irene💖🌹: ik for sure that you’re emotionally intelligent
03/11/2024, 20:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: just been on my mind
03/11/2024, 20:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: lol I don't know😂
03/11/2024, 20:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I know I'm able to understand and manage other people's feelings...but  I'm not good at talking about my feelings
03/11/2024, 20:20 - Irene💖🌹: oh oh okaaaaaayyy
03/11/2024, 20:21 - Irene💖🌹: you’re still emotionally intelligent

13/11/2024, 22:18 - Irene💖🌹: i really don’t know
13/11/2024, 22:18 - Irene💖🌹: it just happens
13/11/2024, 22:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you're sure it's not influenced by something that happened
13/11/2024, 22:20 - Irene💖🌹: maybe

13/11/2024, 22:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I see
13/11/2024, 22:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and what are the most consistent emotions you have being "stone hearted "

13/11/2024, 22:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: for what its worth I like you better when your heart is not a stone🙃
13/11/2024, 22:29 - Irene💖🌹: i’m sure everyone does lol
13/11/2024, 22:29 - Irene💖🌹: i hope it wears off soon
13/11/2024, 22:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: or you've not been getting good food to eat😂 that could be the main cause oo
13/11/2024, 22:31 - Irene💖🌹: 😂😂😂😂

13/11/2024, 22:56 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: sounds like a blast 😂😂
13/11/2024, 22:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so why are you home?
13/11/2024, 22:57 - Irene💖🌹: i got tired of school
13/11/2024, 22:58 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what about school
13/11/2024, 22:58 - Irene💖🌹: academics , social life , everything
13/11/2024, 22:59 - Irene💖🌹: i thought i would be able to cry if i come too
i’ve still not shed a tear
13/11/2024, 23:00 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you're just tired
13/11/2024, 23:00 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it makes sense. sometimes everything can be so suffocating you just need a break from it all
13/11/2024, 23:01 - Irene💖🌹: i guess so
13/11/2024, 23:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what would make you feel like you're ready to go back to school

13/11/2024, 23:09 - Irene💖🌹: yess yess 
thanks a lot lol
13/11/2024, 23:10 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: mmhm
13/11/2024, 23:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what do you value most in a  romantic connection?
13/11/2024, 23:13 - Irene💖🌹: communication
13/11/2024, 23:13 - Irene💖🌹: you?
13/11/2024, 23:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: honesty
13/11/2024, 23:14 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why is that important
13/11/2024, 23:15 - Irene💖🌹: idk ….i just want to know what happens in this persons life, what this person is up to and all that . 
This person should be able to tell me everything and i should do same too. 
Once we’re communicating we’ll know when things are wrong and when they’re right.
13/11/2024, 23:16 - Irene💖🌹: whyyyy???
13/11/2024, 23:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: fair...but I personally feel like knowing everything takes away a lot of the mystery and doesn't give you chance to be intrigued over and over by your person. but that's just my opinion
13/11/2024, 23:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: for me trust is the foundation of every secure relationship. staying true and not being afraid to prove it makes me secure and stops the overthinking
13/11/2024, 23:21 - Irene💖🌹: i see
13/11/2024, 23:21 - Irene💖🌹: cool cool
13/11/2024, 23:22 - Irene💖🌹: what do you mean by not being afraid to prove it?
13/11/2024, 23:23 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: being comfortable me having your password or using your phone
13/11/2024, 23:23 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you know...stuff like that
13/11/2024, 23:25 - Irene💖🌹: 😂😂😂😂
13/11/2024, 23:25 - Irene💖🌹: the way i laughed hard😂
13/11/2024, 23:25 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why😂
13/11/2024, 23:26 - Irene💖🌹: it’s just funny😂
13/11/2024, 23:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: naa tell me why😂😂
13/11/2024, 23:26 - Irene💖🌹: why would you want to use your partners phone?
13/11/2024, 23:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: <Media omitted>
13/11/2024, 23:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: just in case I need to use it...not like I want to
13/11/2024, 23:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and I'll only take that risk I'm very serious about her😂😂
13/11/2024, 23:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: otherwise there's no point lol
13/11/2024, 23:30 - Irene💖🌹: oh okay cool
13/11/2024, 23:32 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
13/11/2024, 23:34 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so you have a vice that you simply haven't done yet because you're not old enough
13/11/2024, 23:35 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I feel like putting a horror movie on
13/11/2024, 23:35 - Irene💖🌹: oh okay

18/11/2024, 23:33 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why do you think catching feelings scares people
18/11/2024, 23:34 - Irene💖🌹: fear of getting hurt i guess

18/11/2024, 23:41 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: among other things
18/11/2024, 23:41 - Irene💖🌹: what are the other things?
18/11/2024, 23:43 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I've always had a problem believing I'm enough. I'm working on that but it's still there
18/11/2024, 23:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I don't want to carry that insecurity into a relationship
18/11/2024, 23:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: could be bad for both of us
18/11/2024, 23:45 - Irene💖🌹: i understand perfectly well 
but did someone ever mention that to you???
18/11/2024, 23:45 - Irene💖🌹: i respect that
18/11/2024, 23:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: some things don't need words to tell
18/11/2024, 23:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
18/11/2024, 23:49 - Irene💖🌹: so you tell yourself that ?? 
i don’t really know much about relationships and life stuff but i only learnt recently that you can’t always please people. Do what makes you happy 
tell yourself you’re enough. You have to remind yourself every single time .
18/11/2024, 23:50 - Irene💖🌹: i’m not sure i sound wise but i hope you do understand. It’s you and you first 
you need to be enough for you before others
18/11/2024, 23:51 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what do you mean you don't sound wise😂
18/11/2024, 23:52 - Irene💖🌹: yuknowww 😂

18/11/2024, 23:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you have no idea how much difference your perspective makes

03/12/2024, 21:50 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: only that?
03/12/2024, 21:51 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: a good vibe too. some companionship, being on the same page in terms of goals and perspectives on the crazy life thing

03/12/2024, 21:56 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: sweet
03/12/2024, 21:56 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I've noticed you're a more laid back person...
03/12/2024, 21:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: is it that you're still trying to figure yourself out?
03/12/2024, 21:58 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I mean in terms of goals and stuff like that
03/12/2024, 22:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: baby
03/12/2024, 22:23 - Irene💖🌹: good good
03/12/2024, 22:24 - Irene💖🌹: I ammm....I open up a lot when I get comfotable tooo. I have sides I don't really show, and I can be loud tooo(especially with my room mates).
03/12/2024, 22:27 - Irene💖🌹: maybe....I remember I've told you that I'm not super ambitious. I'm always okay with what happens
03/12/2024, 22:27 - Irene💖🌹: is it a turn off??
03/12/2024, 22:28 - Irene💖🌹: I can talk for africa tooo....but on a normal I prefer listening
03/12/2024, 22:35 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I want to experience all of those sides
03/12/2024, 22:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I also have sides to me😂 I guess we'll get to figure each other out eventually
03/12/2024, 22:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah I remember
03/12/2024, 22:37 - Irene💖🌹: I hope so
03/12/2024, 22:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: no exactly. I'm an ambitious person alright and I constantly want to be in a better position.
03/12/2024, 22:39 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so I guess I want a person who wants to improve as a person and generally, no matter how little
03/12/2024, 22:40 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I think the best ways we can serve those we love is by becoming better versions of ourselves
03/12/2024, 22:40 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: talk for Africa??😂
03/12/2024, 22:40 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do you think that would be a point of friction for you and i
03/12/2024, 22:43 - Irene💖🌹: nope.... I understand perfectly well. You can't be stagnant as a person. We literally live life and go through all we go through just so we can  become better versions of ourselves
03/12/2024, 22:44 - Irene💖🌹: I'll reconsider...maybe a little of being over ambitious wont hurt
03/12/2024, 22:44 - Irene💖🌹: yasssss.... my sitting pa in class calls me a chatter box or somethnig like that
03/12/2024, 22:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah very true

03/12/2024, 22:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I can imagine. you have so much to day but listening is easier. less energy spent with no risk of saying something weird or silly

05/12/2024, 20:45 - Irene💖🌹: there was nothing any of us could do then. we could only watch
05/12/2024, 20:46 - Irene💖🌹: then there was the issue of having a failed marriage and then having other women come over to threaten her. Domestic violence tooo
05/12/2024, 20:47 - Irene💖🌹: ive seen him beat her sometimes and all we could do was stand behind and cry(my sister and I)
05/12/2024, 20:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm really sorry you experienced that Enyonam
05/12/2024, 20:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: that's harsh
05/12/2024, 20:49 - Irene💖🌹: its fine dw lol....it has long been forgotten
05/12/2024, 20:50 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and she still managed to raise a sweet person like yourself
05/12/2024, 20:50 - Irene💖🌹: awwwn🥹
05/12/2024, 20:50 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: your mum sounds like a resilient person
05/12/2024, 20:51 - Irene💖🌹: she is
05/12/2024, 20:52 - Irene💖🌹: and I grew up with my sister reminding me everytime too that I wasn't wanted . My mommy wasn't expecting another child and my sister wished she was the last child too😂
05/12/2024, 20:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: wait she did that as a joke?
05/12/2024, 20:54 - Irene💖🌹: at first I didn't think of it as a joke ....but now were cool, we joke about literally everything
05/12/2024, 20:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I can understand that
05/12/2024, 20:55 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it still sucks but it becomes something you can laugh over when you grow up
05/12/2024, 20:55 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: just like how my sister convinced me that I'm an orphan and "her parents" adopted me when I was a baby
05/12/2024, 20:56 - Irene💖🌹: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
05/12/2024, 20:56 - Irene💖🌹: sorry for the laugh .....but what did you do to her to deserve this?😂
05/12/2024, 20:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: my crime was existing😂😂
05/12/2024, 20:58 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I used to weep for hours on end. and because I was the only boy at the time I felt deserted when they had to do something and I couldn't be part of it
05/12/2024, 20:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but we laugh over it now😂 she sometimes asks me to go and find my parents because they resurrected 🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
05/12/2024, 20:59 - Irene💖🌹: awwwn my sweet boy🥹dw you'll never feel deserted again
05/12/2024, 21:00 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I hope😂😂

05/12/2024, 21:04 - Irene💖🌹: no need.
05/12/2024, 21:04 - Irene💖🌹: what am I like?
05/12/2024, 21:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you're self aware and a little self conscious,  but underneath that you're sweet, you say what you think seemingly with little restriction, and I honestly think you're way wiser than your initial impression
05/12/2024, 21:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm still learning about you though. I want to know more about you
05/12/2024, 21:10 - Irene💖🌹: fun fact ..... I never  knew I was all these

07/12/2024, 19:28 - Irene💖🌹: I'm sure when he's a bit mature he'll get to understand you better. But you should try and be a bit lenient on him. Elder siblings are difficult

09/12/2024, 22:26 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t have a best friend
09/12/2024, 22:27 - Irene💖🌹: I used to have one then we broke up ….if that’s what it’s called
09/12/2024, 22:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what happened?
09/12/2024, 22:28 - Irene💖🌹: a lot
09/12/2024, 22:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm down to listen
09/12/2024, 22:28 - Irene💖🌹: We went to the same jhs and then the same high school tooo
09/12/2024, 22:28 - Irene💖🌹: When we got to high school she was in green track and then I had gold
09/12/2024, 22:29 - Irene💖🌹: She made new friends i mad new friends…..when we got together she didn’t like that i was close to other people 
I also didn’t like that she was close to other people
09/12/2024, 22:30 - Irene💖🌹: In the end we couldn’t continue being besties 
We’re still cool tho but we don’t call each other besties
09/12/2024, 22:32 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: did it hurt?
09/12/2024, 22:33 - Irene💖🌹: It did
09/12/2024, 22:33 - Irene💖🌹: I was still hurting even after we completed school
09/12/2024, 22:34 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: sorry about that
09/12/2024, 22:35 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: how was your relationship with her like until things got rough
09/12/2024, 22:37 - Irene💖🌹: It was good
09/12/2024, 22:37 - Irene💖🌹: Super good
09/12/2024, 22:38 - Irene💖🌹: It was the kind of friendship other people envy lol….our parents knew 
We even had the same clothes sometimes
09/12/2024, 22:39 - Irene💖🌹: She would be there for me when things weren’t good and then I’d do same for her(we still do tho) 
Just not like we used to
09/12/2024, 22:43 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you guys had a tight bond
09/12/2024, 22:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it makes sense that you both resented the idea of losing each other
09/12/2024, 22:46 - Irene💖🌹: Maybe ….maybe not
09/12/2024, 22:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: how so
09/12/2024, 22:48 - Irene💖🌹: Sometimes I feel it’s my fault
09/12/2024, 22:48 - Irene💖🌹: plus ik she blames it on me tooo
09/12/2024, 22:50 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why?
09/12/2024, 22:51 - Irene💖🌹: I really dunno
09/12/2024, 22:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you don't think she played a part too?
09/12/2024, 22:55 - Irene💖🌹: maybe she did
09/12/2024, 22:55 - Irene💖🌹: Do you know what guilt tripping is?
09/12/2024, 22:55 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: i do
09/12/2024, 22:56 - Irene💖🌹: that is what happened 
someway somehow she made me believe I was the one at fault
09/12/2024, 22:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: mm
09/12/2024, 22:58 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: people can be like that sometimes. pinning it on somebody else feels much better than taking responsibility
09/12/2024, 22:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: losing a close friend sucks no doubt. but you've still made it this far
09/12/2024, 22:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I really hope that as you move on you get to meet more genuine people and build relationships with them
09/12/2024, 23:00 - Irene💖🌹: I hope so too
09/12/2024, 23:00 - Irene💖🌹: But I’m not interested in having best friends or close friends anymore
09/12/2024, 23:01 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why not?
09/12/2024, 23:01 - Irene💖🌹: No reason
09/12/2024, 23:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okay
09/12/2024, 23:03 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but it's a great feeling to have a person who shows up for you when you need them. that no matter how rough things get you guys still stick together
09/12/2024, 23:04 - Irene💖🌹: maybe one day
09/12/2024, 23:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
09/12/2024, 23:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: babe I'm going to bed okay
09/12/2024, 23:15 - Irene💖🌹: good night
09/12/2024, 23:15 - Irene💖🌹: Sleep tight

09/12/2024, 23:30 - Irene💖🌹: Huh??? Nightmares?
09/12/2024, 23:30 - Irene💖🌹: Why?
09/12/2024, 23:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yes
09/12/2024, 23:31 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: adding "babe" or something like that helps

14/12/2024, 00:01 - Irene💖🌹: Just that
14/12/2024, 00:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okay
14/12/2024, 00:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do you think that has affected your behaviour towards the idea of it?
14/12/2024, 00:03 - Irene💖🌹: Maybe
14/12/2024, 00:03 - Irene💖🌹: Plus ik I’m not willing to accept what I feel for you because of that
14/12/2024, 00:04 - Irene💖🌹: Once I feel nothing I won’t get hurt
14/12/2024, 00:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okay
14/12/2024, 00:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so in other words you don't trust me entirely
14/12/2024, 00:05 - Irene💖🌹: Yup
14/12/2024, 00:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: alright
14/12/2024, 00:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: thanks for telling me <This message was edited>
14/12/2024, 00:07 - Irene💖🌹: ???
14/12/2024, 00:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: nothing
14/12/2024, 00:09 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so in that case you don't think you want to be in a relationship with me?
14/12/2024, 00:09 - Irene💖🌹: That’s what it sounded like???
14/12/2024, 00:09 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm asking
14/12/2024, 00:10 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: like you said you don't fully trust me
14/12/2024, 00:10 - Irene💖🌹: Does me not fully trusting you rule out the chances of us being tg???
14/12/2024, 00:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: not necessarily. I'm asking for you though
14/12/2024, 00:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: here's the truth, I can tell withhold how you feel about me a lot of the time. and I understand that's how you keep yourself safe, I do.
14/12/2024, 00:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but it's a distasteful feeling for me knowing that it may end up being one sided in the future
14/12/2024, 00:14 - Irene💖🌹: Ummm …..I think I’m confused rn
14/12/2024, 00:14 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: how so?
14/12/2024, 00:15 - Irene💖🌹: I dunno 
It feels like you already made your own conclusions or smn like that
14/12/2024, 00:15 - Irene💖🌹: You’re scared you’ll get hurt tooo??? Or you’re not interested?
14/12/2024, 00:15 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the first
14/12/2024, 00:16 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: if you get yourself to feel nothing or little, it'll be hard on me
14/12/2024, 00:16 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I can't love halfways
14/12/2024, 00:17 - Irene💖🌹: Umm okay
14/12/2024, 00:17 - Irene💖🌹: So????
14/12/2024, 00:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I think I said it already
14/12/2024, 00:18 - Irene💖🌹: Said what ???
14/12/2024, 00:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: nevermind
14/12/2024, 00:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's cool
14/12/2024, 00:22 - Irene💖🌹: No 
I do mind
14/12/2024, 00:22 - Irene💖🌹: It feels like you want to say something 
You can just say it
14/12/2024, 00:23 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I don't want to be so much more emotionally invested than you. it'll all go to ruins eventually
14/12/2024, 00:24 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's a little more complicated I'm just trying to keep it simple
14/12/2024, 00:25 - Irene💖🌹: Oh okaaayyy
14/12/2024, 00:25 - Irene💖🌹: So then you’re not interested
14/12/2024, 00:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: no I am
14/12/2024, 00:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I really like you
14/12/2024, 00:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm just trying to let you see how making yourself emotionally unavailable sucks for me
14/12/2024, 00:28 - Irene💖🌹: Okay…..you could’ve said this the whole time.
14/12/2024, 00:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: right
14/12/2024, 00:29 - Irene💖🌹: Plus if you need to say something just go ahead and say it okay 
I don’t bite
14/12/2024, 00:30 - Irene💖🌹: I’ll overthink and then get confused
14/12/2024, 00:31 - Irene💖🌹: And okaaaayyy…..I’ll work on me being emotionally unavailable 
I’ll make my love known if I have to ….because I like you a lot tooo

16/12/2024, 00:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do you want to try fingering?
16/12/2024, 00:31 - Irene💖🌹: I dunno
16/12/2024, 00:32 - Irene💖🌹: I doubt 
I don’t really have that much self control mechanisms…..so I try to avoid anything that could lead to sex as much as possible
16/12/2024, 00:33 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I get it I get it
16/12/2024, 00:33 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: even if I swear I have good self control?
16/12/2024, 00:34 - Irene💖🌹: Yup
16/12/2024, 00:34 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the truth is you will feel compelled to asked for more, maybe later if not on the spot
16/12/2024, 00:35 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so you should do it in your own time
16/12/2024, 00:35 - Irene💖🌹: Okaaaaaayyy
16/12/2024, 00:35 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
16/12/2024, 00:35 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: how do you find a guy you're in a relationship with sexualizing you?
16/12/2024, 00:36 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t really know 
I didn’t like the idea of men sexualizing me at first so I resorted to wearing baggy clothes
16/12/2024, 00:37 - Irene💖🌹: But I think I’ll be okay with it if I trust the person
16/12/2024, 00:37 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: oh that was why
16/12/2024, 00:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: cool
16/12/2024, 00:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: from where I stand trust I something you're still building in me
16/12/2024, 00:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: correct me if I'm wrong though
16/12/2024, 00:41 - Irene💖🌹: Yup 
We’re not there yet 
But it’s not looking bad
16/12/2024, 00:41 - Irene💖🌹: Yup
16/12/2024, 00:41 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: right...that's fine by me
16/12/2024, 00:42 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's good to know
16/12/2024, 00:42 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what was your last straw?
16/12/2024, 00:43 - Irene💖🌹: ???
16/12/2024, 00:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what was the one particular thing that happened that made you decide to start wearing baggy
16/12/2024, 00:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what made you say enough
16/12/2024, 00:47 - Irene💖🌹: Oh 
It happened when my body had started developing….yuknow those things 
And I used to dress like every normal girl . But I would get weird glances from men sometimes (I’m sure every girl gets that ) but it was weird for me
16/12/2024, 00:48 - Irene💖🌹: And my mommy didn’t really talk to us about stuff like that 
They tried to avoid it as much as possible 
I only held on to the little I learnt from school then
16/12/2024, 00:49 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: how do you feel when you think about that?
16/12/2024, 00:51 - Irene💖🌹: Normal
16/12/2024, 00:51 - Irene💖🌹: lol
16/12/2024, 00:52 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I see
16/12/2024, 00:52 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: that was actually strong
16/12/2024, 00:52 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: to own your challenges the way you did
16/12/2024, 00:53 - Irene💖🌹: is it ???
16/12/2024, 00:53 - Irene💖🌹: I’ve always thought of it as normal
16/12/2024, 00:55 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: idk it's like girls usually need a little extra attention on these matters so figuring  out on your own is definitely hard
16/12/2024, 00:56 - Irene💖🌹: Oh okay
16/12/2024, 00:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: 😚
16/12/2024, 00:58 - Irene💖🌹: mwah
16/12/2024, 00:58 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: after food, sleep and family, what really matters to you?

16/12/2024, 01:03 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: wow that's good
16/12/2024, 01:03 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and you don't like school 😂
16/12/2024, 01:04 - Irene💖🌹: It’s normal 😂
16/12/2024, 01:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I see
16/12/2024, 01:06 - Irene💖🌹: Yup
16/12/2024, 01:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what's the most scared you've been?
16/12/2024, 01:08 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t think I remember
16/12/2024, 01:08 - Irene💖🌹: I’m actually a scaredy cat 
I get frightened easily
16/12/2024, 01:08 - Irene💖🌹: Then the next moment I’m crying
16/12/2024, 01:08 - Irene💖🌹: You?
16/12/2024, 01:09 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: awwn
16/12/2024, 01:10 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the last one I can remember was last year before we got assigned our programs
16/12/2024, 01:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I had failed a math paper so even though I did well in many others my chances of still landing Cs and stats were very slim and I knew however that went it would determine how my career goes
16/12/2024, 01:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I was given a stat major and Cs minor
16/12/2024, 01:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: terrible program combination for me
16/12/2024, 01:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but before the closed the portal I mustered the courage to go and speak to the moderator and after two days of back and forth I was given my program...Cs and stats
16/12/2024, 01:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: combined major
16/12/2024, 01:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: worst feeling I ever had

16/12/2024, 21:43 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: oh, like how much do you think couples should lean on each other emotionally, financially, or even for making decisions? Or do you think it’s better to stay more independent and handle most things yourself?
16/12/2024, 21:45 - Irene💖🌹: I have no idea ….. you can be independent and handle most things yourself but it’s nice sometimes when yk you have someone that would be there for you

16/12/2024, 21:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okayy
16/12/2024, 21:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: i usually like to stand and work through stuff without getting my partner involved too much, but it's a great feeling when i can
16/12/2024, 21:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: at the same time too i dont like it when my girlfriend is too independent😅for some reason it makes me feel like i'm not that needed

16/12/2024, 22:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: here's what. maybe next time you can just say something that'll help me understand why you don't want to share that than a straightforward no.
16/12/2024, 23:00 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it felt off vibe
16/12/2024, 23:00 - Irene💖🌹: I’m so sorry
16/12/2024, 23:01 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: apology accepted 😌
16/12/2024, 23:01 - Irene💖🌹: okay
16/12/2024, 23:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you were really defensive about that topic
16/12/2024, 23:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do you feel like sharing stuff like that would make you vulnerable to me?
16/12/2024, 23:02 - Irene💖🌹: maybe
16/12/2024, 23:03 - Irene💖🌹: And stuff like this tooo
16/12/2024, 23:04 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you may not notice by how much, but I really understand you
16/12/2024, 23:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the truth is, when I open up about how I feel, it is a risk. puts me in a position to be left hanging
16/12/2024, 23:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but my desire to let you know how I feel about you outweighs the resistant to do sk
16/12/2024, 23:06 - Irene💖🌹: Oh okay
16/12/2024, 23:07 - Irene💖🌹: I’m learning to express what I feel better 
I’m finding it a bit hard
16/12/2024, 23:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: can you tell my why you find it hard?
16/12/2024, 23:09 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t want to look or sound vulnerable
16/12/2024, 23:10 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: fair enough
16/12/2024, 23:11 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what do you think will happen when you express how you feel for me and you sound vulnerable
16/12/2024, 23:12 - Irene💖🌹: Oh and then I’m not sure how you’d react to me telling you how I feel 
I ask myself if it going to irritate you or smn and then I decide 
I don’t like to feel like I’m forcing a vibe on you
16/12/2024, 23:14 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t really know 
Maybe you’d take advantage of that ??  I learnt once a boy starts to think he has you all over him he would change
16/12/2024, 23:16 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: oh you have no idea how much I love it when you express yourself. it'll neither irritate me nor make me feel like something ie being forced
16/12/2024, 23:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: hmm...I see. that's the usual narrative for emotionally unavailable guys
16/12/2024, 23:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm obviously not emotionally unavailable
16/12/2024, 23:18 - Irene💖🌹: Okaaaaaayyy
16/12/2024, 23:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: if anything expressing yourself encourages me to be a better person for you
16/12/2024, 23:19 - Irene💖🌹: If you say so
16/12/2024, 23:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: wait do I give you fuck boy vibes?😄
16/12/2024, 23:21 - Irene💖🌹: Don’t get offended but yes
16/12/2024, 23:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: damn
16/12/2024, 23:24 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what can I do to convince you that I'm not?
16/12/2024, 23:24 - Irene💖🌹: Nothing
16/12/2024, 23:24 - Irene💖🌹: I’m not sure lol
16/12/2024, 23:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I promise I'm not a fuck boy
16/12/2024, 23:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I've been the one who got hurt in all my past relationships. and I don't cheat
16/12/2024, 23:27 - Irene💖🌹: Sorry about that
16/12/2024, 23:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I like you so much I'm willing to not have sex till you're ready and I don't know how long that'll be
16/12/2024, 23:29 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: nah don't be
16/12/2024, 23:30 - Irene💖🌹: Sorry but this isn’t a nice thing to say
16/12/2024, 23:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm sorry
16/12/2024, 23:31 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm just trying to communicate that "fucking" isn't a priority because I like you way beyond that
16/12/2024, 23:31 - Irene💖🌹: Okay…I understand
16/12/2024, 23:31 - Irene💖🌹: And ik that
16/12/2024, 23:32 - Irene💖🌹: But like I said i wouldn’t want to be the one holding you back from having fun 
If you think you can’t anymore you can tell me and I’ll understand
16/12/2024, 23:34 - Irene💖🌹: It would hurt if i found out you did something behind my back . You can do whatever
Just don’t try to act like a saint or hide it …..ie if we end up starting a relationship
16/12/2024, 23:37 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okay
16/12/2024, 23:38 - Irene💖🌹: yh

16/12/2024, 23:42 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm very willing to commit and not do anything with other girls
16/12/2024, 23:43 - Irene💖🌹: okaaayyyy
16/12/2024, 23:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it sucks because I don't know how I can make you believe in me
16/12/2024, 23:46 - Irene💖🌹: I’m sorry if I’m making things difficult
16/12/2024, 23:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I have my own character flaws but among other things I know I'm trust worthy and loyal. I've stood by that for as long as I remember
16/12/2024, 23:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: hmm
16/12/2024, 23:47 - Irene💖🌹: okay
16/12/2024, 23:47 - Irene💖🌹: I understand

16/12/2024, 23:50 - Irene💖🌹: Whyyy
16/12/2024, 23:51 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I've never had to defend my truth like this because I love a girl🙂
16/12/2024, 23:51 - Irene💖🌹: 😂😂😂
16/12/2024, 23:51 - Irene💖🌹: I’m sorry
16/12/2024, 23:52 - Irene💖🌹: Am I hard to convince??
I don’t think so tho
16/12/2024, 23:52 - Irene💖🌹: And I’m sure you understand that  I’m just scared
16/12/2024, 23:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I don't even think I've done any convincing 😂
16/12/2024, 23:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I do. but I'm a natural protector
16/12/2024, 23:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I keep those I love safe. even Charles' sister said she prefers to be close to me when we're out(not bluffing 😅)
16/12/2024, 23:54 - Irene💖🌹: You’ve done some
16/12/2024, 23:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I can't be the one to hurt the person that I love
16/12/2024, 23:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: really??
16/12/2024, 23:54 - Irene💖🌹: Yup
16/12/2024, 23:55 - Irene💖🌹: Okay cool
16/12/2024, 23:55 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm glad to hear that
16/12/2024, 23:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the point I'm trying to make is, I'll keep you safe instead of take advantage of you or your trust in me
16/12/2024, 23:58 - Irene💖🌹: okay…I understand that now
16/12/2024, 23:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
17/12/2024, 00:00 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: would you feel hurt if you found out that I did stuff with other girls not long before we became official?
17/12/2024, 00:03 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: hey
17/12/2024, 00:03 - Irene💖🌹: Yes
17/12/2024, 00:03 - Irene💖🌹: Do you plan on doing that 👀

17/12/2024, 00:11 - Irene💖🌹: I’m not soo sure

17/12/2024, 00:13 - Irene💖🌹: yh
17/12/2024, 00:15 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so I didn't mess the trust up

17/12/2024, 00:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I have?🙂
17/12/2024, 00:18 - Irene💖🌹: Nope
17/12/2024, 00:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's like you're deliberately keeping me in suspense😂 the time is dragging
17/12/2024, 00:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: okay that's good

17/12/2024, 00:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: no problem
17/12/2024, 00:20 - Irene💖🌹: okay
17/12/2024, 00:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do you prefer that I don't touch your body the way I did the last time
17/12/2024, 00:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: your ass particularly
17/12/2024, 00:23 - Irene💖🌹: You touched my ass???
17/12/2024, 00:23 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I did
17/12/2024, 00:23 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you don't remember?
17/12/2024, 00:25 - Irene💖🌹: Nope
17/12/2024, 00:26 - Irene💖🌹: Let’s just say I was enjoying the hug 
I didn’t even care what could happen
17/12/2024, 00:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it was when we were kissing
17/12/2024, 00:26 - Irene💖🌹: It’s fine tho. I didn’t feel violated in any way
17/12/2024, 00:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: alright cool
17/12/2024, 00:27 - Irene💖🌹: I hate how my body reacted to this text 😭
17/12/2024, 00:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'd ask how but you'd probably say no lol
17/12/2024, 00:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: is it bad?
17/12/2024, 00:30 - Irene💖🌹: It is 
I can be super sensitive sometimes 
I hear it’s hormones
17/12/2024, 00:34 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I get it
17/12/2024, 00:34 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you can trust me
17/12/2024, 00:36 - Irene💖🌹: Okay
17/12/2024, 00:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'm a little sleepy
17/12/2024, 00:36 - Irene💖🌹: Okaaaaaayyy 
Good night
17/12/2024, 00:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: don't sack me
17/12/2024, 00:36 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: arhhh I said it😂😂
17/12/2024, 00:36 - Irene💖🌹: 😂
17/12/2024, 00:37 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: slight provocation 😂
17/12/2024, 00:37 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why are you sleepy too?
17/12/2024, 00:37 - Irene💖🌹: Not really
17/12/2024, 00:37 - Irene💖🌹: You should go to bed if you’re sleepy
17/12/2024, 00:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I will
17/12/2024, 00:38 - Irene💖🌹: Okay
17/12/2024, 00:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: can I be vulnerable?
17/12/2024, 00:39 - Irene💖🌹: sure
17/12/2024, 00:39 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: for some days now I'd have periods of heartache because I felt like I had caught feelings for you and you didn't feel the same way
17/12/2024, 00:40 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so it hurt
17/12/2024, 00:40 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and I wasn't talking about it because it feels emasculating to say you want to "feel loved" and stuff like that
17/12/2024, 00:41 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: given that I had talked about it before
17/12/2024, 00:43 - Irene💖🌹: I’m sorry about that 
If I had expressed how i felt better and then not tried to kill what I felt , you wouldn’t go through something like that
17/12/2024, 00:44 - Irene💖🌹: And if you ever want to talk about something you can always tell me .
17/12/2024, 00:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: thanks
17/12/2024, 00:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I try
17/12/2024, 00:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: now before I go...
17/12/2024, 00:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I want to see the saved name😂😂
17/12/2024, 00:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you're not allowed to edit it now😂
17/12/2024, 00:46 - Irene💖🌹: <Media omitted>
17/12/2024, 00:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: 🤣🤣🤣
17/12/2024, 00:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I'll take it😂
17/12/2024, 00:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: do I make you cry?😂

23/12/2024, 22:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so how do you feel about us being in a relationship?
23/12/2024, 22:06 - Irene💖🌹: I like the idea 
I’m open to that
23/12/2024, 22:07 - Irene💖🌹: Except I’m not sure about having you go celibate because of me till I don’t know when
23/12/2024, 22:07 - Irene💖🌹: What do you think??
23/12/2024, 22:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah me too
23/12/2024, 22:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeahh
23/12/2024, 22:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: why aren't you sure?
23/12/2024, 22:14 - Irene💖🌹: I dunno. I don’t think you can and I don’t want to feel pressured
23/12/2024, 22:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: mmm
23/12/2024, 22:18 - Irene💖🌹: yup
23/12/2024, 22:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so how do you think k we can work around that together?
23/12/2024, 22:19 - Irene💖🌹: I really have no idea
23/12/2024, 22:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so your basically saying you don't know how long until you'll feel ready is that it?
23/12/2024, 22:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: or you still feel like 5 years is more reasonable to you
23/12/2024, 22:23 - Irene💖🌹: Yep …this
23/12/2024, 22:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: is it something you see yourself being ready for in the future or you're npt sure of it altogether
23/12/2024, 22:29 - Irene💖🌹: huh….its not like I can run from it forever 
That time will definitely come . But then I don’t want you to have to suffer or go through that because of me 
Body is not firewood <This message was edited>
23/12/2024, 22:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you say run away from like it's something you'd preferrably not do
23/12/2024, 22:30 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: is that the case?
23/12/2024, 22:32 - Irene💖🌹: Nope 
I already told you my reasons
23/12/2024, 22:32 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: mmm
23/12/2024, 22:33 - Irene💖🌹: yup
23/12/2024, 22:34 - Irene💖🌹: How long are you willing to wait?? 
Does the sex matter that much ? 
You want it soon?
23/12/2024, 22:37 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: sex does matter to me, but it's not the most important thing. if we're working towards a place of emotional  and mental safety and security with each other then i'm fine
23/12/2024, 22:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: like i said the last time i was thinking a year, but if you feel like you need more time than that i can only respect your boundary, which i will do gladly if we're doing our best to become good partners for each other
23/12/2024, 22:38 - Irene💖🌹: okay
23/12/2024, 22:39 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: if i'm to be honest, having sex sooner before we build something meaningful puts eberything at risk or becoming shallow.
23/12/2024, 22:39 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
23/12/2024, 22:39 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what do you think about that?
23/12/2024, 22:40 - Irene💖🌹: my mind is blank rn 
I’m trying so hard to focus on the positives
23/12/2024, 22:42 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you know you can tell me anything
23/12/2024, 22:43 - Irene💖🌹: I fear you might only want me for sex and the other pleasures
23/12/2024, 22:43 - Irene💖🌹: sorry
23/12/2024, 22:44 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: can you help me understand why you have that fear?
23/12/2024, 22:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: we listen🧏🏾‍♂️ and we don't judge 🙅🏾‍♂️😂
23/12/2024, 22:46 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t know. That’s just how I feel sometimes
23/12/2024, 22:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: if you have this fear without much to base it on, i might be the best boyfriend there could be for you and you'd still feel like that
23/12/2024, 22:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: that she second you allow us to get intimate i'll be done with you
23/12/2024, 22:49 - Irene💖🌹: mm okay
23/12/2024, 22:52 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: i'd ask only one thing of you. please be a little more interested in who i actually am so that you can take me for exactly that
23/12/2024, 22:53 - Irene💖🌹: Okay
23/12/2024, 22:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
23/12/2024, 22:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what positives where you able to focus on
23/12/2024, 23:00 - Irene💖🌹: That I like you very much
23/12/2024, 23:01 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: hmm okay
23/12/2024, 23:02 - Irene💖🌹: why??
23/12/2024, 23:03 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I don't even know
23/12/2024, 23:03 - Irene💖🌹: oh okay
23/12/2024, 23:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: for some reason I feel sad that you feel this way about me. that I could do stuff behind your back and be disloyal
23/12/2024, 23:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but I need you to believe in me. I wouldn't go back on my word after saying I want to be serious about you
23/12/2024, 23:06 - Irene💖🌹: I’m so sorry …. It’s me having the issue of expressing how I feel again .
23/12/2024, 23:07 - Irene💖🌹: I hope so Kwasi.
23/12/2024, 23:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I understand your fears, they're actually valid. but I'm sure if we take gentle steps you'll eventually come to understand and see for yourself that I won't let a few minutes of pleasure jeopardise the relationship I'm hoping we build together
23/12/2024, 23:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's fine
23/12/2024, 23:09 - Irene💖🌹: okaaaayyy
23/12/2024, 23:10 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeahh

23/12/2024, 23:19 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t know
23/12/2024, 23:19 - Irene💖🌹: We’re not dating already are we???
23/12/2024, 23:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: nah😂

25/12/2024, 20:16 - Irene💖🌹: You’re calling having sex with multiple people exploring??? That’s the new normal??
25/12/2024, 20:17 - Irene💖🌹: Why would I keep myself if I wanted to explore?

25/12/2024, 20:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: fair point👍🏾

29/12/2024, 08:16 - Irene💖🌹: Is it that bad
29/12/2024, 08:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I heard it's because nurses tend to form sexual relations with coworkers. because they spend so much time around them during long shifts and sometimes through the night
29/12/2024, 08:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and nurses usually see themselves as nurturing and their sexual energy as well...yk..because they'll heal the men who need sex

05/01/2025, 21:50 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t really know how to answer this but i understand you were your own person before you met me 
You made decisions and choices on your own or maybe with whom ever you were with then . Nothing should change that , we’re in love but we’re not tied to each other 
You can make your own decisions and all that but I’d appreciate it if you at least tell me what you plan on doing or smn before actually doing it 
It makes me feel like I’m wanted. Like my opinion is needed
05/01/2025, 21:50 - Irene💖🌹: It’s not like my opinion matters that much but we could share ideas
05/01/2025, 21:51 - Irene💖🌹: Plus the last time I heard you said we’re not official yet right???

06/01/2025, 23:03 - Irene💖🌹: Alright
06/01/2025, 23:06 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: a lot of the things about lofe that I know I had to learn by myself. so even though I'm emotionally intelligent and think like an older person, I'm still sensitive,  in the sense that, sometimes I need reassurance and extra love stuff like that...you know, princess stuff. my friends say its too emotional
06/01/2025, 23:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so if stuff like that are a turn off, then they're things that come about me now and then
06/01/2025, 23:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the thing though is, I can shut up about it and you wouldn't know, but I realised that when I do that for a while, I want to be around people less and I can't really feel much about anything
06/01/2025, 23:09 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: there it is
06/01/2025, 23:10 - Irene💖🌹: I seee
06/01/2025, 23:10 - Irene💖🌹: You can be as emotional as you want with me 
I promise I won’t judge 
I need you to be comfortable with me
06/01/2025, 23:11 - Irene💖🌹: Plus I’ll always be here to listen if you need to be vulnerable or smn
06/01/2025, 23:11 - Irene💖🌹: And you’ll always be my pwincess 😙
No one would have to know
06/01/2025, 23:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: 🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
06/01/2025, 23:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: babe I really appreciate that you want to
06/01/2025, 23:13 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but I fear that even though your intentions are to be kind to me, you'll still end up getting weirded out if I do
06/01/2025, 23:14 - Irene💖🌹: I wouldn’t trust me
06/01/2025, 23:15 - Irene💖🌹: If I start feeling weird about it , it would mean I lost interest and that isn’t happening any time soon
06/01/2025, 23:15 - Irene💖🌹: I love you and I love your emotions tooo 
So you can pour them out on me
06/01/2025, 23:16 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I see

06/01/2025, 23:17 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I can't fully assure you, but I'll try
06/01/2025, 23:17 - Irene💖🌹: 😙💕
06/01/2025, 23:17 - Irene💖🌹: I’ll take that
06/01/2025, 23:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah
06/01/2025, 23:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and I also feel that, if I start doing that, you won't be able to comfortably vent our your problems or be as emotional as you'd want to be to me
06/01/2025, 23:20 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: cos who cries to their princess?😂😂
06/01/2025, 23:21 - Irene💖🌹: I hate that you’re more interested in the princess thing😭

10/01/2025, 21:01 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: how did you find that?
10/01/2025, 21:04 - Irene💖🌹: I thought you were trying to be a pwincess😭
10/01/2025, 21:04 - Irene💖🌹: What things?

10/01/2025, 21:08 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: remember?

10/01/2025, 21:10 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: Good girl

10/01/2025, 21:12 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: so, moving forward what is the resolution?
10/01/2025, 21:14 - Irene💖🌹: Resolution???
10/01/2025, 21:15 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah you gotta do something about your principle
10/01/2025, 21:17 - Irene💖🌹: What principle?
10/01/2025, 21:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: does seeing a message from me feel good after a while?
10/01/2025, 21:18 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: this

10/01/2025, 21:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you're missing the point 😂
10/01/2025, 21:19 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeah me too
10/01/2025, 21:21 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what I'm trying to say is that, you should care about making me know that you love me. and you you don't need a grand gesture to do that, but by telling me when you're thinking about me, or a moment we shared, or something you'd want us to try...anything at all that could be on your mind
10/01/2025, 21:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: idk if I make sense
10/01/2025, 21:22 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and it's that same vice versa.
10/01/2025, 21:23 - Irene💖🌹: Okaaaayyy

10/01/2025, 21:26 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I guess😂
10/01/2025, 21:27 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: am I correct to assume you don't know certain things in a relationship?
10/01/2025, 21:27 - Irene💖🌹: Ummm yep
10/01/2025, 21:27 - Irene💖🌹: I’m still learning
10/01/2025, 21:28 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: yeahh I get it

10/01/2025, 21:31 - Irene💖🌹: Is there something you’d like to teach me ?
10/01/2025, 21:32 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: nothing on my mind at the moment
10/01/2025, 21:32 - Irene💖🌹: Okaaaayyy
10/01/2025, 21:33 - Irene💖🌹: I’m ready anytime you have something to teach tho
10/01/2025, 21:33 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: alright baby
10/01/2025, 21:34 - Irene💖🌹: mhm
10/01/2025, 21:38 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what do you often stress about that you shouldn't?
10/01/2025, 21:41 - Irene💖🌹: Studying maybe
10/01/2025, 21:41 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: what about that?
10/01/2025, 21:43 - Irene💖🌹: Idk 
I’m always stressing when it’s time to read my books
10/01/2025, 21:45 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: mmm
10/01/2025, 21:46 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: does it come from an inner childhood experience?🤓
10/01/2025, 21:46 - Irene💖🌹: I don’t think so
10/01/2025, 21:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: <Media omitted>
10/01/2025, 21:47 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: people usually get this joke😂😂
10/01/2025, 21:48 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you see sometimes you shy away from something
10/01/2025, 21:50 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: it's right there for you to do, but instead of doing it, you don't. and usually silence that voice telling you you have to do it with either music, TV, or your phone
10/01/2025, 21:51 - Irene💖🌹: mmmm yup
10/01/2025, 21:52 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: right
10/01/2025, 21:53 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but the thing is, you usually get some form of high after you've done that thing
10/01/2025, 21:54 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: some sense of accomplishment. you feel like you're more responsible,  or tidy and in this case, knowledgeable
10/01/2025, 21:55 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: but regardless,  you're still not doing this thing
10/01/2025, 21:56 - Irene💖🌹: Like rn😭
10/01/2025, 21:56 - Irene💖🌹: I’ll still not do it😭
10/01/2025, 21:56 - Irene💖🌹: But I’ll do it
Just not now
10/01/2025, 21:57 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you barb😂😂 it's inevitable in nearly every pursuit
10/01/2025, 21:58 - Irene💖🌹: yasss
10/01/2025, 21:59 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: usually, you'll find that you're running away from this work because you're afraid to be conquered. that you won't do it well, or you won't understand after many tries, which will make you feel dumb, or that it's simply too hard
10/01/2025, 22:00 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: to realise this, you may have to take a step back and look at your situation carefully
10/01/2025, 22:02 - Irene💖🌹: Let me start reading er
10/01/2025, 22:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I haven't even given you the sauce😂
10/01/2025, 22:02 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: I think you should relax if you think you need to
10/01/2025, 22:04 - Irene💖🌹: Okaaaayyy
10/01/2025, 22:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: the sauce is this. the first challenge you have to deal with is to pick the book up and turn your notifications off
10/01/2025, 22:05 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: After that, break the work down into chunks that you can finish without much hassle
10/01/2025, 22:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: and you should applaud yourself when you do that. you may not believe it but it helps you feel better
10/01/2025, 22:07 - Kwasi💯🇬🇭: you can try this for the first time and see how it goes
10/01/2025, 22:09 - Irene💖🌹: Si
